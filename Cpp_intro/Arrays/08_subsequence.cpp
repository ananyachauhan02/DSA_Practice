/*  
SUBSEQUENCE ---> A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived an array by selecting
zero or more elements, without changingthe order of the remaining elements.

for example : 1 2 0 7 2 0 2
subsequence : 2 7 2 0

number of subsequences of an array with n elements = 2^n

every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray
